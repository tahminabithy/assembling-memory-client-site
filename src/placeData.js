        description: "Ha Long Bay consists of a group of islands and limestone karsts that have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many of the islands are actually tall monolithic cliffs that cannot be walked on, covered in green, lush jungle. Some of these are hollow and house beautiful caves–Dau Go Cave (Wooden Stake Cave) is a good example, a massive cave with three main chambers, multicolored stalagmites, and rock paintings. Many of the islands also have their own enclosed lakes.",

Once a favorite of backpackers, Koh Samui has undergone a remarkable transformation–it now boasts high-end resorts, posh spas, and some of the whitest palm-fringed beaches in Thailand. Chaweng and Lamai beaches attract the bulk of the travelers and are well developed, clean, and full of activities, including opportunities to sail, scuba dive, and swim.",

In fact, the lush, green, terraced rice fields in the province of Ubud are just as stunning.Bali's farmers have been setting rice paddies on terraces for centuries to deal with the hilly terrain of the area–and these areas make for stunning landscapes.",
